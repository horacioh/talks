TBD: Increase Your confidence in UI by using State Machines

## description

Is easy to mix Business logic with UI in any frontend application. This mix makes our apps harder to maintain and modify, which makes it very expensive to a startup to pivot or adapt to change fast. Keep this separation is not easy, you need a lot of experience and discipline to make sure no matter short deadline requirements or external pressure you face do not force you yo take the "hacks" route.

In this talk, I will show you how with the help of state machines we can maintain this separation between business logic and UI while making our codebase easy to refactor, easy to add new features while not breaking others in a simpler and more maintainable way. In short: A new reliable and more future-proof way to create UI.

Working with State Machines brings other advantages: It help us to communicate with other parts of the Product team that may or may not have the knowledge needed to understand code. We can create visualizations of the logic we are implementing, so non-technical people can understand, play and interact with this logic. isn't it that cool?

## Notes & motivations

I believe that learning about State Machines and start using it in my work is one of the most important advances I've made in my professional career as Frontend Developer, not only for all teh known features, but also for the required change in thought process you need to make in order to analyze, describe and implement features in any application. Forcing yurself to think on the model based on teh business logic of any piece of UI is crucial to ensure a good User Experience and more happy customers. Now I can't think of Ui without imagine a state machine ðŸ˜….
