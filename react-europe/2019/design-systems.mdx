## Designers and Developers
need a common language to work **faster** and make products **better**

</Layout>

<Notes>
  - ask the audience about working with designers Developers
  - mention things about branding
  - mention that we are solving the same problems but with different tools, and that leads to the birth of Design Systems
</Notes>

## What is a Design System?

*A design system offers a library of visual style, components, and other concerns documented and released by an individual, team or community as code and design tools so that adopting products can be more efficient and cohesive.*

</Layout>

<Notes>Basically is a set of rules and constraints, that serve as patterns and guidelines to guide the purpose and voice of a brand or product.</Notes>

### With a Design System in Place:

- Designers can focus on the UI primitives of the system
- Developers can focus on building the most efficient and performant Component APIs that apply this principles using UI primitives
- Product Designers can focus on UX and iterate faster building layouts with these components

**It helps your team to be consistent in every part of the product lifecycle**

A little Story:
## From UX to Design System
This is the story of Paul

</Layout>

### The Goal was to teach Paul how to build UI Primitives with
### `React` & `styled-components`
*and eventually give him full access and ownership on the design system we where using for the product we were building*

</Layout>

---

<Layout>

## Paul's background

- UX & Product designer
- he know HTML & CSS and understand semantics
- he does not know any JavaScript
- he does not know anything about git

</Layout>

---

<Layout>

### Results

- Paul's now independent enough to modify and create UI Primitives
- He can now iterate faster from hix UX research and change page layout without any blockers
- He *understands* how components are built, so we iterate less when creating new ones.
- The product evolves a lot faster because we all used the same language to work on the product.
